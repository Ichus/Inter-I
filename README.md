The goal of the project is to create a data set of ideas and the relationships between them. This data may be queried to return an idea and a number of its strong relations.

The overall vision extends to allow the ability of navigating amongst ideas, according to desired context and scope; as well as tools for analyzing natural language. In time the information will be made available via an API. The aim is to provide a greater semantic context for user input and natural language information.
